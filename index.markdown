Hi there üëã! I'm Iurii, a passionate software developer with a drive to create impactful solutions. My journey in tech began with a fascination for how code can transform ideas into reality. Over the years, I've honed my skills in building scalable web applications using modern technologies like Elixir, TypeScript, and React.

What excites me most is the intersection of technology and collaboration. I believe that clean code, robust architecture, and continuous learning are essential for delivering high-quality software. My experiences in technical support have also taught me the importance of empathy and effective communication in resolving complex issues.

Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, hiking ü•æüèîÔ∏è, and mentoring others to help them grow in their careers. I'm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share my passion for innovation and collaboration.

Feel free to explore my projects, reach out for collaborations, or simply say hello!
