Some of the tools I use everyday. I'm always looking for new tools to add to this list.

- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) everywhere.

**Coding**

- [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) The best tool overall, but heavy sometimes. Some extensions are falling apart while you expect them to perform.
- [Supermaven](https://supermaven.com/) AI Copilot for your VS code. Helps you write code faster.
- [Zed](https://zed.dev/) Very light, has some nice themes, but lacking integrations.

**Terminal**

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) Just must have. I've been introduced to this command-line tool 8 year ago and I am still using it every day!
- [Oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) Customize your command-line with the best tool that dev community uses broadly.

**Git**

- [GitX](https://gitx.frim.nl/) The best git commiting tool. I've been using it for a long time.
- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) Something that also works well, showing your repo in a tree-like structure.

**Databases**

- [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico2/) Amazing PSQL client. Simple, quick, and easy to use.

**APIs**

- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) Makes API testing easy.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) The same but with a different look.

**Communication**

- [Linear](https://linear.app/) Project management tool. The best way to coordinate work with your team.
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) No comments, just the most popular communication tool.
- [Discord](https://discord.com/) Once everything else is dead (yeah, hello Slack) this fella is somehow always there.

**Other**

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) Run your apps anywhere.
- [Colima](https://colima.io/) Local Kubernetes. Run your containers easily.
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.
